# suburi

This is where I train.

"Suburi" (素振り) is a term used in Japanese to describe the act of practicing a swing,
particularly in sports such as Baseball or Kendo, by simulating hitting a ball or facing an opponent
without actually doing so.
This helps improve technique and build muscle strength.
More generally, it often refers to the movements performed for practice or preparation before actually
engaging in an activity.
